        <div>
            <p>Two roads diverged in a <span id="color"></span> wood,</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
        </div> 
        <div>
            <p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Because it was <span id="adj"></span>  and wanted wear;</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
            <p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
        </div>    
        <div>
            <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
        </div>    
        <div>
            <p>And both that <span id="time"></span>  equally lay</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
            <p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
            <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
            <p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
        </div>   
        <div>
            <p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
