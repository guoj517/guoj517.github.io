        <p>“Their life is mysterious, it is like a forest; from far off it seems a unity, it can be comprehended, described, but closer it begins to separate, to break into light and shadow, the density blinds one. Within there is no form, only prodigious detail that reaches everywhere: exotic sounds, spills of sunlight, foliage, fallen trees, small beasts that flee at the sound of a twig-snap, insects, silence, flowers.
    And all of this, dependent, closely woven, all of it is deceiving. There are really two kinds of life. There is, as Viri says, the one people believe you are living, and there is the other. <i><b>is this other which causes the trouble, this other we long to see.</i></b>"</p>

MUDs combine elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a natural language."</p>

14. Update the following inline CSS to make the class applied to the following HTML Paragraph Element colored Green and set its font size to 24 pixels.

    }
</style>
 <div class="text14">
"Traditional MUDs implement a role-playing video game set in a fantasy world populated by fictional characters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers. The objective of this sort of game is to slay monsters, explore a fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by roleplaying, and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the Dungeons & Dragons series of games."

</style>
<div class="hover-class">
"Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to play; some may accept donations or allow players to purchase virtual items, while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard telnet clients, or specialized MUD clients, which are designed to improve the userexperience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as The Mud Connector."

A language that allows the webpage to interact with users and makes the webpages more interesting.
