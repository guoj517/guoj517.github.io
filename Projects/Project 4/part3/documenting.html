<h2>
    The client provided a collection of images that capture random yet artistic human behaviors. Upon close examination of the images, the notion of edgelessness had rooted itself during the early stage of conceptualization. The idea of devising a “pagemap”, on the other hand, came with the exploratory nature that came naturally with the edgeless experience. In order to achieve the ideal effects, however, certain technical difficulties were to be addressed. I adopted coding solutions from websites to create the “pagemap” element, and used Javascript randomization for image placement. Another unexpected feature that came with the code allows the images to shuffle positions every time the user refreshes the page, giving the site an organic characteristic.
